From nuclear power stations which dump around half the energy they generate into water courses, to industrial processes, low tech heat recovery 

It can often seem at government policy level, energy and electricity are confused. It may be genuine or a delibrate attempt to exploit the media and public ignorance for political benefit. The announcement of a target for all electricity to be generated from zero carbon sources by 2035 sounded bold, except that electricity only accounts for around 20% of all our energy consumption. 




At the most basic, low temperature (<100°C) solar thermal collectors used in some swimming pool systems are simply black plastic tibes with a pipe running through them, enough to heat large volumes of water to 25-30 degrees. Efficient flat plat collectors take this a step further with a glass front and water runs through a thin PVC bladder, the most efficient are vacuum collectors, where a series of evacuated glass tubes with coolant inside are  with a a pipe running  made from plastic, a glass cover Energy technologies don't get more simple. In many ways this has been it's downfall, there is little money to be made patenting technologies or lucrative mineral mines to be commodified.



From domestic hot water and space heating to swimming pool heating and industrial processes, heating water directly through globally is one of the most common technologies 

Prior to tumbling PV prices as a results of the very much welcome and long overdue boom in Photovoltaic (PV) the solar energy market was dominated by solar hot water systems, mostly in Germanic and Scandinavian countries. Ten years ago Germany had the largest solar thermal market in Europe, with 2.1 million m2 collector area, in the period to 2019 this grew by only 500,000m2, largely due to the favourable market conditions for PV, however a subsidy scheme which started in 2020 [@bafaBAFAHeizenMit2020] has led to a single year 26% increase in systems, showing market growth is possible with the right policies.

The major drawback of such systems was the size of a tank, the complexity of plumbing and the need to have a backup system. Essentially a house might need three energy systems, solar thermal roof panels, a backup heating source, likely natural gas and a grid electricity supply. Once the price of PV fell, the ease of a 'plug and play' system with no moving parts remove the bottom from solar thermal market.

Yet, despite the relative simplicity of PV systems, one major advantage that hot water systems still hold is their efficiency. Whilst PV systems convert around 15-20% of incident solar irradiation into electricity, solar thermal panels can convert as much as 80% of incident energy into heat. Add to this the embodied energy per kWh of a flat plat solar panel is the lowest of any energy technology, it is around ten times lower than solar PV, and will generate around xx times more energy during it's lifetime. As well as this, unlike electronic systems, it doesn't require any rare earth metals.

Decarbonising the UKs heating and hot water has always been a challenging topic made all the more difficult by the nations enthusiasm for the domestic boiler in contrast with our Germanic and Scandinavian neighbours that opted for district heating systems. Crucially, district heating also allows waste heat from power stations and other industrial facilities to be utilised. For decades centralised power stations have provided electricity in the UK with very few using the heat produced. The best turbines are only able to convert up to 60% of the energy in the fuel to electricity, but in general most plants are around 40% efficient, meaning 60% of the energy is lost to the atmosphere. 

EUrope has 192 solar district heating plants

However, switching heating systems house by house can be complex and expensive, leaving many, including the government to cross their fingers for Hydrogen.

Like most energy efficiency and renewable technologies upfront investment is required, which means they are often the first thing to be scrimped on when building new houses, but a heat exchanger in a house is often many times smaller than a gas boiler, requires a fraction of the maintainance and is silent. They also don't emit any pollutants. It is estimated that the second largest source of NOx in London is from domestic gas boilers, whilst significantly lower than most transport emissions where the monitoring is focused emissions from domestic boilers take place right outside peoples windows.



appear more expensive on paper they take away much of the stress of maintainance, with homes largely only requiring a small heat exchanger. They also make it far easier to change energy source. Essentially hot water from any heat source can connected to a district heating system with no need to tinker with peoples homes and the costs spread across all users. This opens up technologies that would be difficult to operate at a domestic level, such as solar thermal, to be considered.

coupled with energy efficiency improvements in homes, which not only reduce fuel, but improve comfort and living standards.


Electricity is important and useful, but heat is far more, and the solutions are easier and less environmentally damaging, but like Ethyl Lead, less glamorous and profitable.

Based on available land area and proximity to district heating systems already in place, the IEAs task 52 has identified the UK as the second highest solar heat potential in Europe closely behind Poland [@trierSolarDistrictHeating2018].



An indirect incentive to the Danish SDH development has been the requirement for all DH
utilities to obtain a certain amount of energy savings each year. If a utility cannot reach
the required savings, it has to buy credits from another utility, which has a surplus of
"energy saving credits", because it was able to exceed its energy saving target. These
credits are quoted on a stock market on their own, thus varying in price per MWh of saved
heat. Previously, the first year of solar heat production counted as energy savings, thus
creating a surplus of valuable credits for the utility, which could pay back a part of the
investment. This option ended in December 2016, which pushed many utilities to
complete several solar thermal plants before this deadline. A new agreement [12] limits
the amount of credits which are created by a SDH system to the first 8,000 MWh, which
correspond to an installed solar collector area of around 20,000 m2
. However, this
agreement is presently limited until the summer of 2019. [@trierSolarDistrictHeating2018]



However, the sectors rollercoaster ride continue, with the Danish market suffering from a shift in government policy to heat pumps[@eppAcquisitionStrategicImportance2020]. In 2020 the countries largest manufacturer Arcon-Sunmark went bust citing an unclear regulatory framework and a delay in extending the energy savings agreement between Danish utilities and the Danish energy ministry at the end of 2016 and in 2019 causing huge fluctuations in business[@meyerDenmarkLargeHeat2021].

Germany has leapfrogged Denmark to become the leading market for solar district heating in 2020 with China in third place, leading the way on industrial process heat with Mexico not far behind [@iea-shcIEASHCKey2021]



No need for lithium or rare earth metals.


Having thermal storage opens up waste heat recovery. The larger scale the storage the lower the surface area to volume ratio and the higher the efficiency.

The external costs of climate change are only just starting to bite, the cost of 'cheap' fossil fuels will be footed by generations to come. Gronigen in the Netherlands is a perfect gas study of the failure to account for external costs. Decades of extracting seemingly abundant and plentiful natural gas from under the town has resulted in constant earthquakes and subsidence, with a huge bill on the horizon.

In terms of kWh per m2 of land solar thermal beats solar PV, but it still requires significant land area which in urban areas can be expensive. Vra system is just on the edge of town, a 1km high temperature pipe loses 0.5 degree, the slightly more recent pipe to the green gas site is double the distance but with only the same loss thanks to double skin technology. In addition the footprint of the system on the land is only the mounting posts, wildlife and livestock can flourish under the land, and in most cases whilst not as asthetically pleasing to some as a green field the environmental credentials can be many times greater. In Kenya for example yields of crops grown under solar panels is higher as the ground holds moisture better and harsh direct sun is reduced.





Other options are large flat roofs of shopping centres or warehouses.

A lot of research work is going into this, but nothing like the research money that is poured into nuclear or the money spent every year on dealing with the nuclear legacy.



Denmark dominates with more than half of the 195 schemes in the solar database in the country.

Personally I live in a flat that is on the district heating network supplying heating and hot water, even in summer this is supplied by natural gas.


Setting up an industry for generations of lucrative waste contracts and nuclear accidents slowly eroding precious land.





To add further to the homegrown credentials, the panels used at the facility are manufactured by Aarlborg CSP, just 30km south of the site.



Solar thermal ideally suited to swimming pools, in the USA and Canada this is the dominant use for the technology with 12.9 GW of unglazed plastic collectors, used predominantly in outdoor pools in summer, so effective at providing low temperature heat there is no need for glazing. 

Low tech, low resource, simple technology, no single person or company is going to get rich with it.

The IEA have been consistently down playing the role of solar and wind, instead focusing on nuclear, carbon capture and storage it is an annual ritual their annual report expreses shock at the meteoric rise in renewables. This is matched with the research budgets of countries who continue to throw money at fossil fuel exploration and nuclear technologies whilst wind, solar, wave and tidal steam ahead with their comparitevly measely budgets.

A certain stuffiness and conservatism within institutions that is holding back genuine progress.

This is despite  not because of government support, which has gone the other way, with the PV feed in tariff ripped up in 2012 and the cheapest form of electricity onshore wind banned in the UK in 2015 whilst Spain not only ended the feed in tariff for PV but ripped up contracts, destroying the entire countries solar industry in the process. This is whilst the current systems are propped up by billions in government fossil fuels subsidies

Fresh from a masters degree in Renewable energy I spent 6 months as an intern at the Energy and Climate Change department in UNIDO and was astounded at the attitude that developing countries were going to be required to go through the same fossil fuel phases as developed countries in order to take themselves out of poverty, despite their abundant renewable resources.

The COP was hyjacked by a handful of politicians who still believe economic prosperity relies on enabling. A few days later Dehli had to shut down due to unbearable air pollution from the same coal power stations

Despite continually proclaiming to be concerned about the  Governments have spent years dragging heals on renewable investment due to the upfront costs required but are now on the verge of eye watering subsidies to energy suppliers and households to get us which look like to dwarf any investment.

[Solar and Wind complement each other very well](https://rpubs.com/Blaise/solar_wind), with the most abudant months of wind in the 1st and 4th quarters and solar intensity at its greatest in 2nd and 3rd 

Rather frustratingly the IPCC seem to have almost entirely overlooked solar thermal, briefly mentioned with reference to domestic hot water production, but summary tables for GHG emissions per kWh jump between solar PV and concentrated solar thermal, a far less mature and complex technology. Whilst on paper trough solar thermal system can generate even more energy, they rely on clear sky considitons and provide more energy in summer, something that conventional solar thermal manages fine.
