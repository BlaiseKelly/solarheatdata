  abstract = {The renewable energy sources are often presented as ‘clean’ sources, not considering the environmental impacts related to their manufacture. The production of the renewable plants, like every production process, entails a consumption of energy and raw materials as well as the release of pollutants. Furthermore, the impacts related to some life cycle phases (as maintenance or installation) are sometimes neglected or not adequately investigated. The energy and the environmental performances of one of the most common renewable technologies have been studied: the solar thermal collector for sanitary warm water demand. A life cycle assessment (LCA) has been performed following the international standards of series ISO 14040. The aim is to trace the product's eco-profile that synthesises the main energy and environmental impacts related to the whole product's life cycle. The following phases have been investigated: production and deliver of energy and raw materials, production process, installation, maintenance, disposal and transports occurring during each step. The analysis is carried out on the basis of data directly collected in an Italian factory.},

The two systems investigated consist of an energy efficient conventional system, using heat pumps for heating, cooling and domestic hot water; the second design widely deploys solar thermal panels coupled to district heating infrastructure and a borehole seasonal thermal storage. The analysis is based on the Life Cycle Assessment methodology and includes the stages of raw materials and energy supply, system manufacturing, use stage of the systems, generation and use of energy on-site, maintenance and components’ substitution, and explores the performances of the systems on a life cycle perspective thanks to the use of different indicators of ILCD 2011 Midpoint impact assessment method. The solar-based system, performs better than the conventional system from the point of view of all indicators used in the study. In detail, ozone depletion and land use can be reduced of about 79.7\% and 27\% respectively, while the remaining impact categories show a reduction of about 39–56\%. These results can be extended to other similar systems operating under similar weather constraints, energy systems included in the operation, thermal loads requirements. Moreover, the study is based on the premises and assumptions of real documented case studies in Canada, thus further reinforcing the solidity of the results.},

  abstract = {Compared to domestic solar water heating, solar thermal process heat (SPH) generation is still a very small market with only a few hundred installations registered worldwide. A wide variety of collector technologies and system concepts is applied to supply industrial, commercial, or agricultural processes. Optimal supply of solar heat to such processes can be complex and requires know-how on large-scale solar thermal systems, process engineering, and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, SPH for very suitable applications is already cost competitive to conventional heating. Low-temperature solar heat below 90°C is used, e.g., for preheating, washing, cleaning, and drying. For these purposes, standard domestic system components or air collectors are applied. Temperatures between 90 and 150°C are provided by pressurized water systems with improved nontracking collectors or by one-axis tracked process heat collectors like small Fresnel collectors or parabolic troughs. Above 150°C, tracking collectors with pressurized water or thermal oil are used. In addition, direct steam generation within the collectors is possible. Above 400°C, two-axis tracked collectors like parabolic dishes or central receiver heliostat fields with thermal oil or molten salt as heat carrier can be used. This chapter reports on potential and state of the art in SPH. Promising “low-hanging-fruit” applications are discussed and examples of realized plants are described. Finally, research and development needs and current future trends are reported.},

The system includes low-temperature space heating with seasonal ground storage of solar heat. Heating is supplied by 2400m2 solar collectors and individual electrical heaters for supplementary heating. The ground storage comprises about 60,000m3 of crystalline rock with 100 boreholes drilled to 65m depth and fitted with double U-pipes. The collectors will have favourable working conditions but the store is rather small, the estimated heat loss from the heat store is about 40\% of stored solar heat and the average solar fraction is estimated to 70\% after 3–5 years of operation. An initial evaluation after 2 years of operation shows that, although problems have occurred and several parts seem to work less efficient than expected, the overall system idea works as intended.},

  abstract = {District heating has been used as heating energy provider for buildings since the half of 19th century. It evolved together with buildings towards higher energy efficiency. Today the energy production systems, hooked up to the district heating network, are able to produce both heating energy and electricity. In some particular cases, also cooling energy is produced. Nowadays it is extensively used in Nordic countries, especially in Finland; subject of this study. Actually, Finnish district heating is facing important challenges, since new European regulations are coming into play affecting both energy generation methods and building energy efficiency. Basically, buildings are becoming more efficient and renewable technologies more cost-effective. Particularly, buildings consume less heating energy, due to high level of insulation, and adopt low temperature indoor distribution systems. Furthermore, new electrical appliances are penetrating into buildings, generating also cooling loads in summer even in cold climates. In addition to these, new effective technologies are available on the market. All these aspects are inducing the district heating to evolve. This study discusses relevant issues for a smooth transformation of the current Finnish district heating towards the future generation. Authors, after an extensive review of the existing district heating operating practices and of the promising innovative technologies network integration, suggested possible and realistic technologies integration scenarios.},

  abstract = {Heat demand in buildings is responsible for around 40\% of all energy use in middle to high latitude countries. The combination of district heating systems with solar thermal energy and seasonal thermal energy storage has successfully reduced the carbon intensity of heating in different countries, such as Denmark, Germany and Canada. The potentials of such systems to decarbonise the heat demand in the UK has also been highlighted in different reports. Nevertheless, bottom-up quantitative studies to support or dismissive these potentials are very limited. The quantification can be provided by simulating a solar district heating system using UK-specific inputs, such as heat demand and weather profiles. In this study, a validated simulation model is used to study the performance of solar district heating systems with seasonal thermal storage deployed in the UK. The case study is based on the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Canada, which has a relatively high solar fraction. The results show that the system is technically feasible to be implemented in the UK but that it has lower technical performance. A systematic analysis of the influence of the main components on the system performance shows that not only the solar supply and heat demand need to be balanced but also that the long-term storage needs to be appropriately sized. The relatively lower solar fraction could be offset by installing more long-term storage and implementing the system to supply new-built houses with better energy performance rather than the current building stock of older homes. Financially, the system still needs to be supported by encouraging policies to make it competitive with incumbent technologies. The results and the validated model open the possibility to design bespoke solar district heating systems for the UK and other countries in middle to high latitudes.},

  abstract = {The Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada utilizes a solar thermal system with borehole seasonal storage to supply space heating to 52 detached energy-efficient homes through a district heating network. Systems of similar size and configuration have been constructed in Europe, however, this is the first system of this type designed to supply more than 90\% of the space heating with solar energy and the first operating in such a cold climate (5200 degree C-days). Solar heat captured in 2293 m2 of flat-plate collectors, mounted on the roofs of detached garages, is stored in soil underground and later when needed for space heating, is extracted and distributed through a district system to each home in the subdivision. Independent solar domestic hot water systems installed on every house are designed to supply more than 50\% of the water heating load. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from energy efficiency improvements and solar energy supply exceed 5 tonnes per house. The seasonal storage utilizes approximately 34,000 m3 of earth and a grid of 144 boreholes with single u-tube heat exchangers. The system is configured to maintain the centre of the field at the highest temperature to maximize heating capacity and the outer edges at the lowest temperature to minimize losses. A short -term thermal storage consisting of 240 m3 of water is used to interconnect the collection, distribution and seasonal heat storage subsystems. The system has undergone detailed monitoring since it was brought into service in July 2007 to characterize its performance and to improve the TRNSYS model employed in its design. A solar fraction of 97\% in its fifth year of operation, convincingly confirms the design target, a solar fraction of more than 90\% in year five, has been met. This paper describes the system and its operation, presents 5 years of measured performance and compares those results against the TRNSYS predicted performance for the same period.},
